[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/decomputed/projectEuler.svg?branch=Clojure)](https://travis-ci.org/decomputed/projectEuler)

This repo contains solutions to Project Euler problems in some functional programming languages.

Each language has it's own branch so you can checkout just the branch for the language you're interested in.

You're currently in the Clojure branch.
